# 💫 Welcome to the O'Reilly CI/CD for Data Lakes - lakeFS Course Challenge!

Start by ⭐️ starring [lakeFS open source](https://go.lakefs.io/oreilly-course) project.

## Setup

Start by cloning this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS-samples && cd cd lakeFS-samples/oreilly-cicd-data-lakes
```

To spin up the environment, make sure you have [Docker Compose installed on your computer](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and run:
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

It would then take a few minutes to spin up a [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and a fully functional [lakeFS](https://lakefs.io/) repository with a few datasets ready for you.

Once ready, you'll be presented with a really cool banner that kind of looks like this:
