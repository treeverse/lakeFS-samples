**This sample repository captures a collection of notebooks, dockerized applications and code snippets that demonstrate how to use [lakeFS Enterprise](https://docs.lakefs.io/understand/enterprise/).**

## Let's Get Started üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS-samples.git
cd lakeFS-samples/02_lakefs_enterprise
```

### **Run a lakeFS Enterprise server**

Login to [Treeverse Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/treeverse) by using the granted token so Fluffy proprietary image can be retrieved. [Contact Sales](https://lakefs.io/contact-sales/) to get the token for Fluffy:

```bash
docker login -u externallakefs
```

Run following command to provision a lakeFS Enterprise server as well as MinIO for your object store, plus Jupyter:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Once the stack's up and running, open the Jupyter Notebook (http://localhost:8894) and check out the [catalog of sample notebooks](../00_notebooks/00_index.ipynb) to explore lakeFS. 

Once you've finished, run the following to remove all the containers: 

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Environment Details

* **Jupyter Notebook** is based on the [Jupyter PySpark notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/pyspark-notebook/) and provides an interactive environment in which to explore lakeFS using Python and PySpark. 
* **lakeFS Enterprise** is provisioned as part of this environment.
* **MinIO** is provided as an S3-compatible object store. You can use other S3-compatible object stores include S3, GCS, as well as Azure Blob Storage.
