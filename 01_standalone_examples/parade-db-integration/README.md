# Integration of lakeFS with ParadeDB

Start by ‚≠êÔ∏è starring [lakeFS open source](https://go.lakefs.io/oreilly-course) project.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook and ParadeDB which you can run on your local machine.

## Let's Get Started üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS-samples && cd lakeFS-samples/01_standalone_examples/parade-db-integration
   ```

You now have two options: 

### **Run a Notebook server with your existing lakeFS Server**

If you have already [installed lakeFS](https://docs.lakefs.io/deploy/) or are utilizing [lakeFS cloud](https://lakefs.cloud/), all you need to run is the Jupyter notebook and ParadeDB:


   ```bash
   docker compose up 
   ```

### **Don't have a lakeFS Server or Object Store?**

If you want to provision a lakeFS server as well as MinIO for your object store, plus Jupyter and ParadeDB then bring up the full stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile local-lakefs up
   ```

### URLs and login details

* Jupyter http://localhost:8895/

If you've brought up the full stack you'll also have: 

* LakeFS http://localhost:8007/ (`AKIAIOSFOLKFSSAMPLES` / `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)
* MinIO http://localhost:9007/ (`minioadmin`/`minioadmin`)


## Demo Instructions

Open Jupyter UI [http://localhost:8895](http://localhost:8895) in your web browser. Open "ParadeDB Demo" notebook from Jupyter UI and follow the instructions.
