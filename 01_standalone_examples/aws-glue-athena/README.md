# Integration of lakeFS with Glue Catalog and Athena

Start by ⭐️ starring [lakeFS open source](https://go.lakefs.io/oreilly-course) project.

This repository includes following Glue jobs:

1. glue-exporter-athena-demo-notebook:
* Use Case: Isolated Dev/Test Environments
* This interactive notebook demonstrate integration of lakeFS with [Glue Catalog](https://docs.lakefs.io/integrations/glue_metastore.html) and [Athena](https://docs.lakefs.io/integrations/athena.html). 

2. glue-lakefs-demo:
* Use Case: Version Control of multi-buckets pipelines
* In data engineering pipelines, it is common to have distinct buckets that serve different purposes. These buckets are typically named and categorized based on their respective stages in the data processing pipeline. When implementing lakeFS, it may be necessary to maintain separate physical buckets for each stage. However, it is important to version control all changes made to each bucket and link between different versions to track the evolution of the data through the pipeline.

## Prerequisites
* lakeFS installed and running in your AWS environment or in the lakeFS Cloud. If you don't have lakeFS already running then either use [lakeFS Cloud](https://lakefs.cloud/) which provides free lakeFS server on-demand with a single click or [Deploy lakeFS on AWS](https://docs.lakefs.io/howto/deploy/aws.html) doc.
